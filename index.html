            <p id ="id_experience_content_2_1"> - At the end of the first semester, I was fortunate to learn about RoboMaster,
               the national university-level robotics competition.
               I was immediately captivated by it, which also led me to choose robotics engineering as my major.</p> 
               <br><p id ="id_experience_content_2_2"> 
              - At the same time, I joined the university's RoboMaster team, ARTINX. 
              Within six months, thanks to the team's believing and teaching, I went from being a complete novice
              to mastering electrical control and hardware design. Eventually, I took charge of controlling 
              one of the main robots. We competed in the final national competition as a team and 
              achieved satisfactory results, making it to the top 16 in the country.</p>

            <p id ="id_experience_content_3_1">- Due to the team's excellent performance last year,
              many senior members chose to retire after achieving their goals.
               For the sake of the team, I felt it was necessary for me to stay. More importantly, 
               I felt that I didn't perform my best last year, which let the team down. To prove myself or to make amends, 
               I decided to continue for another year.</p><br>
              <p id ="id_experience_content_3_2">
              - Due to my lack of foundation, I diligently studied various subjects, including C++ programming, circuit design, 
              data structures, and the basics of robotics. Additionally, I read and comprehended all existing electrical control 
              codes within the team that year. To strengthen my foundation, 
              I also took many courses outside the Major of robotics engineering during those two semesters.</p><br>
              <p id ="id_experience_content_3_3">
              - However, due to the departure of key team members and technological setbacks,

            <p id ="id_experience_content_4_1">
              - in the second semester of my second year, due to taking multiple courses, 
              I had a pile-up of course projects. Considering time constraints, 
              I plan to collaborate with another student specializing in mechanical design (a teammate from ARTINX) 
              to complete a large-scale project that meets all course requirements.
            </p><br>
            <p id ="id_experience_content_4_2">
            - After dividing tasks such as mechanical design, circuit control, and algorithm simulation with another classmate, 
            we successfully completed a hexapod robot within one month. The robot is capable of autonomous walking and maintaining
             its body level in various environments. Finally, we designed a poster, wrote a technical document, 
             created an introduction video, and even filmed a short play featuring the robot as the main character.
            </p><br>
            <p id ="id_experience_content_4_3">
            - This project received unanimous praise from all course instructors and was regarded as the most accomplished and challenging project.

          <p id ="id_experience_content_5_1">- In the third semester, despite facing pressure to pursue further studies, 
            I chose to continue dedicating myself fully for another year(we called it all in). 
            This decision stemmed from both the team's need for me and my two years of experience. 
            I undertook the significant responsibility of being the team's head of electrical control, 
            striving to live up to this role. I expanded my knowledge by studying modern control theory, 
            STM32 system architecture, and computer operating systems. Additionally, 
            in preparation for the new year's electrical control training, 
            I completed over 100,000 words of documentation and created more than 400 PowerPoint slides during the summer break. 
            These materials covered embedded systems, communication protocols, basic C++ syntax, electromechanical systems, and more.</p>

            - Looking back, it was an intense period where I barely slept, getting only 5 to 6 hours a night,
               working tirelessly until exhaustion set in. I want to express my gratitude to my teammates and fate itself. 
               In that year's national competition, ARTINX once again reached its peak, securing the 11th place nationwide.

            - Reflecting on my three years of experience, I participated in over 10 large-scale competitions, 
            overseeing the circuit design and overall control of multiple robots. I was honored with 3 national-level awards 
            and 4 provincial-level awards, gaining invaluable engineering experience and forging friendships with like-minded engineers. 
            I am grateful to the ARTINX team and to RoboMaster.

            Research often hinges on innovative ideas, and after delving into a paper with my doctoral colleague for over a month,

            - Drawing on my previous engineering experience, I adeptly crafted the sensor body. Under the guidance of my doctoral colleague,

            <p id ="id_experience_content_7_4">
            - Through corresponding experiments and algorithm design, we obtained some results. We documented the entire process into an academic paper,
