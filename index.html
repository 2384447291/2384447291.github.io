            <p>Jun 2020 - Jan 2021</p>
            <p> - Entering university for the first time, I quickly 
              integrated into campus life and found myself adapting 
              well. </p> 
              <br>
              - Thanks to my quick adaptation to the university learning pace, my GPA ranked 
              in the top 20% of the entire school during my freshman year.</p>

            <h3> second semester of my freshman year(S/1) </h3>  
            <p>Jan 2021 - Aug 2021</p>
            <p> - At the end of the first semester, I was fortunate to learn about RoboMaster,
               the national university-level robotics competition.
               I was immediately captivated by it, which also led me to choose robotics engineering as my major.</p> 
               <br> 
              - At the same time, I joined the university's RoboMaster team, ARTINX. 
              Within six months, thanks to the team's believing and teaching, I went from being a complete novice
              to mastering electrical control and hardware design. Eventually, I took charge of controlling 
              one of the main robots. We competed in the final national competition as a team and 
              achieved satisfactory results, making it to the top 16 in the country.</p>

            <h3> First semester of my sophomore year(F/2) </h3>  
            <p>Aug 2021 - Jun 2022</p>
            <p>- Due to the team's excellent performance last year,
              many senior members chose to retire after achieving their goals.
               For the sake of the team, I felt it was necessary for me to stay. More importantly, 
               I felt that I didn't perform my best last year, which let the team down. To prove myself or to make amends, 
               I decided to continue for another year.</p>
              <br>
              - Due to my lack of foundation, I diligently studied various subjects, including C++ programming, circuit design, 
              data structures, and the basics of robotics. Additionally, I read and comprehended all existing electrical control 
              codes within the team that year. To strengthen my foundation, 
              I also took many courses outside the Major of robotics engineering during those two semesters.</p>
              <br>
              - However, due to the departure of key team members and technological setbacks, 
              we were unable to achieve the desired results and did not advance to the national competition.

            <h3> First semester of my senior year(S/2) </h3>  
            <p>Mar 2022 - Jun 2022</p>
            <p>
              - in the second semester of my second year, due to taking multiple courses, 
              I had a pile-up of course projects. Considering time constraints, 
              I plan to collaborate with another student specializing in mechanical design (a teammate from ARTINX) 
              to complete a large-scale project that meets all course requirements.</p>
            </br>
            - After dividing tasks such as mechanical design, circuit control, and algorithm simulation with another classmate, 
            we successfully completed a hexapod robot within one month. The robot is capable of autonomous walking and maintaining
             its body level in various environments. Finally, we designed a poster, wrote a technical document, 
             created an introduction video, and even filmed a short play featuring the robot as the main character.</p>
            </br>
            - This project received unanimous praise from all course instructors and was regarded as the most accomplished and challenging project.

          <p>- In the third semester, despite facing pressure to pursue further studies, 
            I chose to continue dedicating myself fully for another year(we called it all in). 
            This decision stemmed from both the team's need for me and my two years of experience. 
            I undertook the significant responsibility of being the team's head of electrical control, 
            striving to live up to this role. I expanded my knowledge by studying modern control theory, 
            STM32 system architecture, and computer operating systems. Additionally, 
            in preparation for the new year's electrical control training, 
            I completed over 100,000 words of documentation and created more than 400 PowerPoint slides during the summer break. 
            These materials covered embedded systems, communication protocols, basic C++ syntax, electromechanical systems, and more.</p>

            - Looking back, it was an intense period where I barely slept, getting only 5 to 6 hours a night,
               working tirelessly until exhaustion set in. I want to express my gratitude to my teammates and fate itself. 
               In that year's national competition, ARTINX once again reached its peak, securing the 11th place nationwide.</p>
            </br>
            - Reflecting on my three years of experience, I participated in over 10 large-scale competitions, 
            overseeing the circuit design and overall control of multiple robots. I was honored with 3 national-level awards 
            and 4 provincial-level awards, gaining invaluable engineering experience and forging friendships with like-minded engineers. 
            I am grateful to the ARTINX team and to RoboMaster.

            </br>
            - I am grateful to my teachers and doctoral peers for their guidance, which enabled me to quickly grasp the research process 
              and become involved in the tactile sensor project in the lab.
               Research often hinges on innovative ideas, and after delving into a paper with my doctoral colleague for over a month, 
               we identified a novel approach to enhance existing tactile sensors.</p>
              </br>
              - Drawing on my previous engineering experience, I adeptly crafted the sensor body. Under the guidance of my doctoral colleague, 
               we swiftly iterated on the sensor body twice, encompassing both hardware and casing design.</p>
            </br>
            - Through corresponding experiments and algorithm design, we obtained some results. We documented the entire process into an academic paper, 
            which was honored to be accepted at the international conference EECR.

              - After four years of university study, I am about to graduate successfully. This period of time has not only earned me recognition from the school,
               making me a recipient of the Outstanding Graduate Award at the university level, but also enabled me to forge friendships with a group of like-minded engineering peers. </p>
              </br>- The experiences of these four years have been truly remarkable, so I plan to create a webpage to document it all. </p>
              </br>- At the same time, I want to express my gratitude for your
